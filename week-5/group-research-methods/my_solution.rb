# Person 1's solution
def my_array_finding_method(source, thing_to_find)

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I used the select method to iterate the a copied element of the array and used the include method to find all strings that has the value from thing_to_find.  And for my hash method, I also used the select method to iterate through the array, but if the value equals to the thing_to_find arguement, then I would push its key into a new array.
#
# The select method is very similar to the each method in which it iterates each element of an array or hash.  But it returns a new array/hash element if it passes as true in my block.

# The include method returns true if the key we determine matches with our input.
