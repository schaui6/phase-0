#  Reflection

=begin
What did you learn about making code readable by working on this challenge?

It taught me that it is easier to read so that I can refactor and better understand what the code is doing.

Did you learn any new methods? What did you learn about them?

No new methods learned.  But I learned more about hashes and to use driver code to see what the hash is doing.

What did you learn about accessing data in hashes?

That I can run methods on the accessed hash.

What concepts were solidified when working through this challenge?

How hashes worked through iteration and refactoring.
