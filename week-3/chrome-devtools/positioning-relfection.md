**How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?**

*You can use Chrome's devtools to view the code and what is displayed at the same time.  This allows us to see how code affects the results in real time.  It is great to see bugs as it is happening, it helps us to see where we want to position elements, and it also let us visualize if a format style is the one we really want to use.*

**How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?**

*From my understanding of DOM, DOM is just basically a map of my HTML tags. I prefer to look at it as branches of a tree. And in CSS you have the selector where you can select HTML elements.  You can use CSS to selcect the elments(object in this case) to resize elements.*

**What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?**

* Relative by default is at a static position.  Until you set certain margins the element, the element will start applying the margins and move relative to the static position.  Absolute is setting the static position in a set place at all times.  Fixed is keeping an element in the same place on the screen even when scrolling.  A great use of the fix position is to have a navation bar set in a particular place on the screen and is always there even when scrolling a few pages down.  Fixed and static were the 2 I found easiest to use.  I had trouble with absolute relative mainly because I didn't understand how they worked, but a few youtube videos later the little lightbulb flashed.*

**What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?**

* It might be easier to explain with the box model courtesy of [W3Schools.org](https://www.w3schhols.org).  We have multiple layers. If we look from inside the box, starting with content, the layer or space between the content and the border is the padding layer.  Then the layer between the padding and margin is the border and beyond the border is the margin.*

**What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)**

*At first I hated it, mostly because I didn't understand how to use Chrome's Devtools, but once I had the hang of it it wasn't as bad.  The way we entered and remove code painful because I kept forgeting to hit the enter key to acceot my values. *
