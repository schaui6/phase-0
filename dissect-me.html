  Version Control
  </h1><p>Version control is a crucial component to writing code, and one way to do it is through using git and the website GitHub. Version control is basically the idea that as software(or any project actually) is developing, you will want to try out experimental ideas with your code that may or may not be something you want in the final product. In order to do this, you create "branches" off of the master code that allow to explore different possibilities. If the new feature doesn't break everything and turns out to be something good, then you can merge it back to the master code. Having the ability to move around like that is already great, but another huge component of Version Control is the organization of the edits. Being able to look back and see all the commits and even restore the master branch to a previous state are huge tools in effectively writing code. Git is a great version control system because it allows you to do all of these things pretty easily with relatively straightforward syntax. Simple arguments like "git status," "git add," and "git commit" give the user a lot of power and make it a easy tool to get things done.</p></article>

<p>To clone a repo go into the repo and click the "copy to clipboard" button to copy the clone url.  In terminal "cd" in to your git directory.  Enter "git clone "clone url"" into the command line.</p>

<h1>What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?</h1>

I struggled to properly read the instructions.  I learned that I needed to take a short break and go back into it and it was a breeze.

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?</h1>

<p>To create a new repo click the the "+" icon at the top right corner of the screen and click "new repository".  Enter the name of the new repo and click "create repository".</p>

<h1>To fork a repo click "fork" button below the "+" icon on the top right corner of the screen.  Select which profile you would like to for the repo to.</h1>

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

<article> and <section>, I like to use these two tags to differentiate my main content.  I don't usually have a ton of main content, so I can avoid using id's and classes as much as possible to reduce clutter.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

It applies each element in the order as it is interperted.  From left to right, top to bottom. As it interperte each line it applies the element and then moves on to the next element.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I leaned that you can use the "command and /" keys to comment and uncomment.  I also learned what a snippet is and what it does and how it works.  I can see myself making a few more handy snippets to reduce redundancies.

What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I'm not sure if I am inpertreting this question correctly, but I found that pressing the command and / keys helped with commenting in html.
