##What is a one-to-one database?

A one-to-one relationship is a single relationship to another.  An example would be that a person can only have one biological father. We are only looking at the relationship of the person to the father. But if were to look at the relationship a father may have more than one child, that would be a one-to-many relationship.

##When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

When you have a child-parent relationship. When looking at databases, there will always be a parent for each child. Or each state only and one capital.
