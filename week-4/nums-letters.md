##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

When you use division with integers the return will output an integer.  When you use division with floats or floats with integers, the return output will be a float.  An example would be, 10 / 4 => 2 and 10.0 / 4 = 2.5*

````
puts 365*24
8760
````

puts 365*24*60*10
5256000
````

For example if you gave a math expression the name addition.  Instead of typing out the whole expression, you can simply enter the name of the variable to calculate the expression.

##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
