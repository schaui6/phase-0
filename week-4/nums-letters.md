##What does puts do?

Puts prompts your output/string onto the console and creates a new line.

##What is an integer? What is a float?

An interger is a whole number without a decimal and a float is not a number with a decimals such 7.2.

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

When you use division with integers the return will output an integer.  When you use division with floats or floats with integers, the return output will be a float.  An example would be, 10 / 4 => 2 and 10.0 / 4 = 2.5 (Also note that if there are remainders with integers, ruby will round down to the nearest whole number)

````
puts 365*24
8760
````

````
puts 365*24*60*10
5256000
````

##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

+ equals addition, - equals subtraction, * equals multiplications, and / equals division.  You use these symbols in an expression and ruby will calculate it.

##What is the difference between integers and floats?

Inegers do not have decimals(if there are any remainders, ruby will round down to the nearest whole number) and floats do have decimals

##What is the difference between integer and float division?

When you divide using integers your answer will be whole numbers.  When you divide using a float it will return a float as an answer.

##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are words are phrases and numbers if set between ' ' or " ".  Anything in quotation marks is interpreted as a string in ruby. You would want to use strings when you want to prompt a user for an input or when you want to puts a message to the user/reader/audience.

##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are names given to define strings and numbers within your method. You would want to use them because instead of typing out all the code you reference the name ,sort of like a shortcut, to have the same effect.  For example if you gave a math expression the name addition.  Instead of typing out the whole expression, you can simply enter the name of the variable to calculate the expression. Local variables also have a built-in "seat belt" to prevent calling the variable from outside the method and creating some funky outcomes.

##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This challenge wasn't bad.  The hardest part was inperetating what the instructions were.  I had to reread the instructions a few more times for it to click in my head.  This challenge did refresh my memory on the basics of ruby.
