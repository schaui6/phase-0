<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

        It was exciting to be able to see what I really learned.Being about to practice more of what we learned was really helpful and it help solidify my understanding.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

        It helped with sectioning and organizing our outline.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

        I think I a good job at keeping to best practices, although I ended making tables which I wasn't considering at the time as formatting.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

        The good about HTML is that is easy to understand for the most part.  With a few basic elements, anyone can make a website.  It also allows us to be creative.  The bad is that it may get messy quickly so organization is key.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

  Most elements have have an end tag and it is very similar to writing an outline of an essay, a head, body, paragraphs, and end.
