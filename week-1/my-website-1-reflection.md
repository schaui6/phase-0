Describe what open source means.

Open source is we are able to see the source code and use it for free.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open Source is a great way for people to share code, build a community, and to further develop the code at a faster rate due to easy access for adoption rate.  Coding is an art and I can see why people would be nervouse or protective, because anyone may see and use it any way they choose. I would be nervous as well, but it's for the greater good in advancement.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses protects our intellectual properties, but does all others to use our source code.  It allows users to also adopt the code much like open source.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

This challenge allowed me more practice with push requests and adding feature branches.  I struggled initially with pull requests, I need to work on this concept a bit more.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Yes, Codecademy's git tutorial helped tremendously for me to further understand and allowed me more practice with git to make this work.
